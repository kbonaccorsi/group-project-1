## Project Requirements
You and your group will use everything you‚Äôve learned over the past six units to create a real-world front-end application that you‚Äôll be able to showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfil the following requirements:
* conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from
  multiple server-side API requests.

* work collaboratively

* learn agile development methodologies

* write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues

* use GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks

* implement feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests 

* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Grading
| Requirement      | Weight |
| ---------------- | ------ |

| GitHub Profile   | 40%    |
| Resume           | 10%    |

## Instructions
1. [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)
2. [Updated GitHub Profile](#updated-github-profile)
3. [Updated Resume](#updated-resume)
4. [Updated LinkedIn](#updated-linkedin)

## Updated Portfolio
üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [career services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Your updated portfolio should:
1. Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or Portfolio Pieces. For each project, make sure you have the following:

	* Project title

	* Link to the deployed version

	* Link to the GitHub repository

	* Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design
Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:
* Mobile-first design
* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.
* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile 
Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:

1. Profile picture or avatar

  * A photo or an avatar other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

2. Biography

3. Email address. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a developer email.

4. Link to your deployed portfolio

5. At least 2 pinned repositories:

	* Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

	* Click "Customize your pins"

	* Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 Portfolio Pieces assignments that you would like to share

6. Follow a few of your classmates and/or other developers. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

7. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

	* Title of app

	* Live link to deployed app

	* List of technologies used

	* 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is

	* 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app

	* License (usually MIT)
	
	* Contact information for you and any collaborators

8. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.

## Updated Resume 

üíÅ Need help building a resume? Check out the [career services milestone resources](https://mycareerspot.org/resume).

Submit a clear, concise, and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job you‚Äôre looking for.

Your resume should include:

* a heading with your name, phone number, professional email address, links to LinkedIn, portfolio and GitHub. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

* a technical skills section, with all programming languages and technologies listed

* 3 of your strongest projects/Portfolio Pieces assignments with brief description, languages used, and URL

## Updated LinkedIn

üíÅ Need help updating your LinkedIn? Check out the [career services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Update your LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github and portfolio.
